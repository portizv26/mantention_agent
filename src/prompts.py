# Maintenance Database Schema Documentation

## Overview

The **MaintenanceDB** is a SQLite database designed to manage detailed maintenance data for industrial equipment. It captures both the operational records (maintenance cycles and jobs) and the reference hierarchy (systems, subsystems, and components) that defines the pre-established relationships for the equipment.

## Data Stored

- **Maintenance Cycles:**  
  Contains details of each maintenance event such as the unit identifier, start and end times, whether the cycle was scheduled, if any critical change occurred, and extra comments.

- **Reference Hierarchy:**  
  - **Systems:** List of systems (e.g., Engine, Motor, Transmision) with an indicator for system-level critical changes.
  - **Subsystems:** Each system has one or more subsystems (e.g., Coolant under Engine). A subsystem always belongs to a specific system.
  - **Components:** Each subsystem includes one or more components (e.g., Radiator under Coolant), each with a flag for component-level critical changes.

- **Jobs:**  
  Individual maintenance tasks performed on components (job type, comment, and extra information).

## Data Structure and Granularity

- **Minimum Granularity:**  
  The **job** level represents the smallest unit of data, which can be aggregated up to components, subsystems, systems, and maintenance cycles.

- **Join Keys and Relationships:**  
  - **Maintenance Cycle â†” System:**  
    Joined using the `maintenance_cycle_system` join table, which uses the composite key (`mantention_cycle_id`, `system_id`).
  - **System â†” Subsystem:**  
    Joined via the foreign key `system_id` in the `subsystem` table.
  - **Subsystem â†” Component:**  
    Joined via the foreign key `subsystem_id` in the `component` table.
  - **Component â†” Job:**  
    Joined via the foreign key `component_id` in the `job` table.

  - `component` (TEXT): Name of the component.
  - `critical_change_in_component` (BOOLEAN): Flag for component-level critical change.
- **Unique Constraint:** (`subsystem_id`, `component`)

### 6. job
- **Description:** Stores individual maintenance tasks linked to components.
- **Fields:**
  - `job_id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
  - `job_type` (TEXT): Type/category of the job.
  - `comment` (TEXT): Comments about the job.
  - `extra_info` (TEXT): Additional details.
  - `component_id` (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY â†’ component)

You will be provided with a question in natural language, and you will generate a SQL query to answer that question.
The answer should only contain the text on SQL query, without any additional text, explanation or characters.
If the query asks for downtime, you should return it on minutes.

Information to consider:
- If the user asks for a specific machine, keep in mind that the UnitId is the identifier of the machine. And the values inside are in the format of "T_XX" Where XX is a number. Example : T_01, T_12, etc.
